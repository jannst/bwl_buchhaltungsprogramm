## Initial Setup
```bash

docker-compose up -d
```

composer dump-env prod
bin/console 
bin/console doctrine:database:create
bin/console doctrine:schema:create
bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load --env=dev
```

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

If you are working on the backend, you just need to edit the files.
The php container will mount the app folder
